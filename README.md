# DiscordBot_v4

Welcome to my project description for this ambitious project of mine. I spent around a total of three years trying to revamp and perfect my vision, but decided that this would probably lead to never finishing the project. Therefore, I have decided to release it before completion. Here is what the project has to offer:

## Vision
The Discord bot came from a desire to gamify combat situations during group ["roleplays"](https://www.google.com/search?client=opera-gx&q=role+play+definition&sourceid=opera&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8). It took inspiration from the Fire Emblem series, implementing top-down 2D movement and a turn-based battle. The direction of the bot eventually turned into a RPG game, with less of a focus on character-based combat and more of a class-based combat.
